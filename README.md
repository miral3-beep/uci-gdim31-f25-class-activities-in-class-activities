hello world

### W2
1. R, G, and B values are represented in decimals for each shade. A slight change in each of the decimals would change the shade entirely. Therefore, RGB values must be stored as floats.
2. _bounce variable has to be a int because we count ball bounces as a whole number.
3. The importance of the semicolon because it keeps the content inside the statement. 

### W3
The input is the friendship level, and the character will respond in different paragraphs as strings. The other parameter is a boolean value, which is either true or false, and the player will respond based on whether they know the secret or not.

The class would act as a toolbox, and the components are the tools inside it. Methods would be the functions each tool does, and members would be the different kinds of uses and situations the tools could be used for. 
Ball will get brighter because the GetColorMultiplier makes it so that the ball color becomes lighter as it bounces. 

### W4
Table 9

Line 5  declares the member variable float and sets the move speed at 1, line 22 the translation gets the input from the player and in 25 it would move the game object from the translation sentence. 
### W5
1. I asked if vectors are used on 3D surfaces, can they be applied on a 2D surface as well? Yes
2. To make the deer walk to the player using the Navmesh. The deer being the monobehaviour and the transform being the component.
3. What member variables does this code need- transform
4. What methods does this class need - Start()
5. The method should indicate that the code will run when the game starts.
